# POO-Project-CESI-ROUEN-A2-2023

Creation of an application to manage online sales of electronic components

This project was carried out in 1 week as part of an "Object-oriented programming" block with the CESI engineering school. The aim of this project was to create an application developed in C++/CLI and to create an administrator interface that communicated with a database to manage an online sales site for electronic components. Several interfaces were requested, and I was provided with a set of specifications for the creation of this project. I also added administrator input security management, filtering input fields and blocking sql injections. Finally, unit testing in C# enabled me to verify my results and validate the application, which I named "Gedget Grove".
